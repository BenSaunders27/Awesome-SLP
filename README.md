# Awesome-SLP
A list of awesome work on Sign Language Production (SLP). It contains an extensive literature review of the field of deep-learning based SLP, with all relevant publications.

I am gathering these papers as literature for my PhD, and thought others may be interested. If you have any updates, please feel free to contribute or email me at b.saunders@surrey.ac.uk.

These are ordered by year, and I try to find the appropriate conference for each.
