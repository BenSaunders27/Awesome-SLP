# Awesome-SLP
A list of awesome work on Sign Language Production (SLP). It contains an extensive review of the field of deep-learning based SLP, with all relevant publications.

I am gathering these papers (Currently 10 papers) as literature for my PhD, and thought others may be interested. If you have any updates, please feel free to contribute or email me at b.saunders@surrey.ac.uk.

These are ordered by year, and I try to find the appropriate conference for each.
