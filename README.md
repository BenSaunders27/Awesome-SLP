# Awesome-SLP
A list of awesome work on Sign Language Production (SLP), the automatic translation from Spoken Language sentences to Sign Language Sequences. It contains an extensive literature review of the field of deep-learning based SLP, with all relevant publications.

I am gathering these papers as literature for my PhD, and thought others may be interested. If you have any updates, please feel free to contribute or email me at b.saunders@surrey.ac.uk.

These are ordered by year, and I try to find the appropriate conference for each.
